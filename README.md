      <h3>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
      <p>
        I'm currently studying <strong>Systems Analysis and Development</strong>, and I love bringing ideas to life through code and design.<br><br>
        ðŸ’» I mainly work with <strong>PHP</strong> and I'm always exploring ways to improve my skills.<br>
        ðŸŽ¨ I'm also a big fan of <strong>Figma</strong> â€” designing intuitive and clean interfaces is something I really enjoy.<br><br>
        I'm passionate about building creative and functional projects, and always open to learning something new!
